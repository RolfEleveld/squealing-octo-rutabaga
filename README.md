# Marbitec fna Processing
Marbitec wants to process the setof fna files for having a complete picture of all complete genome structures
The process is triggered from a PowerShell script in the private repository which also includes the answer file.
When the ARM is deployed using the button below then the Dashboard will request the user to input the required data.

## Intent
To set up and crate an environmnt for processing the fna files using [MUMmer 3.23](http://mummer.sourceforge.net) or   
[ncbi-blast-2.3+](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/) from the python [average_nucleotide_identity.py](https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani) script with a possibility to run this script in a multi-processing scale out way.
